Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

Observations:

With Capomulin, there was less tumor volume compared to Placebo, Infubinol, and Ketapril (these three were very close to each other in results. Ketapril caused a bit more in Tumor Volume compared to the Placebo

According to the data, Capomulin had the least amount of metastatic spread compared to the others. Although, it shows that the drugs do provide some sort of treatment compared to the placebo. Less spread with Capomulin and Infubinol. Ketapril seems to have caught up with the Placebo after 20 days, could be because the mice have adjusted to the drugs and the effects werenâ€™t as potent as the others

In terms of survival, it seems like Capomulin would be the best overall drug due to the drug providing less tumor volume and less metastatic spread. Though Infubinol did better than Ketapril in the earlier graphs, it did worse in terms of survival compared to Placebo

Capomulin is the better drug overall in this study, this can be seen on the bar graph with a -19% tumor volume change, while the others are above 0, some hitting over 40%.
